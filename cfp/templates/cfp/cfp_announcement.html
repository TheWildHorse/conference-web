Call for Proposals - WebCamp Zagreb 2015
WebCamp Zagreb is a technology-oriented conference built by the community for the community. We’re aimed at software developers and designers, regardless of their technology preference. The conference is organized by volunteers from local user groups acting together under the wing of the WebCamp nonprofit organization with the mission to promote the exchange of knowledge and experiences in a healthy cooperative environment.

Submit your proposal now!
It’s a great pleasure to invite you to WebCamp Zagreb 2015, a tech conference devoted to web development & design, which will be held on October 3rd & 4th 2015 in Zagreb, Croatia. This is a call to participate: help us build a great conference once again by becoming a speaker! With great opportunities to network with fellow developers & designers the most important part of every great conference are expert talks.

Feel free to submit all of your ideas, we have a diverse range of interests so all submissions are welcome! While it’s not important which technology, language or tool you use, let your suggestions be interesting and fresh to a broad audience. Just make the talk web related (even if it’s a long shot). We love first hand experience talks!
Talks should be of a technical nature, not promotional. Try to cover both good and bad sides and keep the presentation as objective as possible. If you want to present a specific project, give us an inside perspective. Just keep in mind that we’re looking for tech talks, not sales pitches.

Here are some ideas to get you started: application architecture, hosting, cloud solutions, software development methodology, application testing, development/design tools, client and server side development, mobile web, specific technologies/tools/libraries, design, UI/UX, design methodology, SQL or NoSQL databases and data storages, tech experience you love or dislike, managing a web team or an organization, collaboration tools, distributed or remote teamwork experiences.
This year you can choose between a 25 and 45 minute talk and this includes the Q&A at the end. This limitation will be strictly enforced to keep the conference schedule on track. It’s highly recommended to limit your talk to 20 or 40 minutes to allow 5 minutes for Q&A. All talks will be held in English.

Proposals can be submitted through the CFP Application Form.
