                    <p>It’s a great pleasure to invite you to WebCamp Zagreb 2015, a tech conference devoted to web development &amp; design, which will be held on October 3rd &amp; 4th 2015 in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>

                    <p>This is a call to participate: help us build a great conference once again by becoming a speaker. With great opportunities to network with fellow developers &amp; designers the most important part of every great conference are expert talks.</p>

                    <p>Feel free to submit all of your ideas, we have a diverse range of interests so all submissions are welcome! While it’s not important which technology, language or tool you use, let your suggestions be interesting and fresh to a broad audience. Just make the talk web related (even if it’s a long shot). We love first hand experience talks!
                    Talks should be of a technical nature, not promotional. Try to cover both good and bad sides and keep the presentation as objective as possible. If you want to present a specific project, give us an inside perspective. Just keep in mind that we’re looking for tech talks, not sales pitches.</p>

                    <p>Here are some ideas to get you started: application architecture, hosting, cloud solutions, software development methodology, application testing, development/design tools, client and server side development, mobile web, specific technologies/tools/libraries, design, UI/UX, design methodology, SQL or NoSQL databases and data storages, tech experience you love or dislike, managing a web team or an organization, collaboration tools, distributed or remote teamwork experiences.</p>

                    <p>This year you can choose between a 25 and 45 minute talk and this includes the Q&amp;A at the end. This limitation will be strictly enforced to keep the conference schedule on track. It’s highly recommended to limit your talk to 20 or 40 minutes to allow 5 minutes for Q&amp;A. All talks will be held in English.</p>

                    <p>By submitting a talk, you agree to our <a href="/code">Code of Conduct</a> which will be firmly enforced.</p>
