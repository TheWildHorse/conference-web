                <h2 class="Intro-title">WebCamp Zagreb 2015</h2>
                <div class="Intro-body">
                    <p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that this year&rsquo;s WebCamp Zagreb conference will be held on the 3rd and 4th of October 2015 at the <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/yoRl8">Hypo Expo XXI conference center.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Last year&#39;s conference was amazing, and this year we are keen to take it a step further. We&rsquo;re proud of being a community conference and one of our primary goals is to promote the growth of meetup communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>After careful consideration of conferences passed, we have concluded that giving the majority of our tickets for free has become a major organizational problem for several reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>First of all, more than a quarter of the free ticket holders do not show up for the conference - &ldquo;it&rsquo;s free so I&rsquo;ll grab one just in case&rdquo;. This meant that we had a lot of unclaimed badges and swag bags.
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondly, although the conference hall was not filled to capacity, people who wanted to come could not get a ticket.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, giving away free tickets en masse did not prove to be as stimulating to the meetup community as we had hoped.
                    </p>
                    <p>Those are the reasons why we decided to charge regular tickets this year, and not give away most of the tickets like we had done in previous years.
                    </p>
                    <p>There will still be a substantial amount of free tickets given out. These will be given to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>people who are active in their perspective communities; anyone who has held or will hold a talk at one of our meetups
                        </li>
                        <li>our volunteers, both old and new
                        </li>
                        <li>select student groups
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This way we hope to encourage the participation of people in the meetup community, decrease the number of no-shows and use the additional income to improve the conference and invite more speakers, both domestic and foreign.
                    </p>
                    <p>Early bird tickets will cost 300HRK (~&euro;40) for both conference days, and the price will go up to 500HRK (~&euro;65) after early bird tickets have been sold out.
                    </p>
